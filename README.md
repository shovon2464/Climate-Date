# Edmonton Climate Data Visualization 
Weather profoundly impacts various aspects of human life, influencing sectors like agriculture, tourism, urban planning, and industry. The meteorological department employs sensors across different locations to collect weather data. This project focuses on analyzing Edmonton's weather conditions by visualizing changes in snow, rain, and temperature over recent years.
## Getting Started :
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally for development and testing purposes. Refer to the "Running Code" section below for instructions on running the project.
## Dataset:
We utilize the City of Edmonton's Open Data Portal to access weather datasets. This portal offers Edmonton's city data in various formats, including CSV and XML. We use the Socrata Open Data API (SODA) to fetch weather data from the portal in JSON format for real-time visualization. The dataset spans from January 1, 2000, to the present, with daily updates. It encompasses 67,868 records capturing day-to-day weather conditions.
